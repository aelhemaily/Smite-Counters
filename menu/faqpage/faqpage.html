                <div class="faq-answer">This website is an attempt to help new-comers to Smite and even experienced players understand counter-matchups, items and strategies for enemy gods that you might be struggling against. It is the product of being a fan of and playing the game for almost a decade now. In the home section, you may search each god to find their page with info about counter picks, items and playstyles that help against them. VVGF and VVGL to all.</div>

                <div class="faq-answer">The information on the website is a mix of personal opinion, extensive gameplay experience (nearly a decade of playing the game), and research to understand community opinions on matchups.</div>

                <div class="faq-question">Why launch the website with 130 gods from Smite 1 when Smite 2 is being tested?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The decision to launch the website with gods from Smite 1 is based on several factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The basic formula of gods and counters is not changing radically with Smite 2.</li>
                        <li>The website will be updated with Smite 2 items and/or gods depending on kit changes.</li>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Why is [insert god name] showing up so much as a counter?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Some gods are mostly designed to be counter picks. For example, Ah Puch’s kit is built to counter healers, and as such, he will feature more as a counter than, say, Gilgamesh, who is your standard basic warrior.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Why is [your favorite god] not listed more often as a counter?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>There are several reasons why your favorite god may not be listed as a counter:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The list of “notable counters” for a god is a guiding list; many times, it is not exhaustive.</li>
                        <li>Some gods are not counter picks by virtue of their kits. Being a solid pick and being a counter pick are not the same.</li>
